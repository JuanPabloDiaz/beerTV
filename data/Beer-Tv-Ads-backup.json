    "spot_description": "During Super Bowl LV, outdoor party-goers wonder aloud when Bud Light started making lemonade. Most likely, they posit, it was when 2020 started serving up all those lemons. Flashbacks to the fateful year show that is exactly what happened -- literal lemons rained from the sky, destroying all manner of activity in their path. Kisses, cars, flights, haircuts, and even weddings did not survive the citrus year. Suffice to say, the year was full of lemons -- and, yes, we all know the common saying about situations like this. After a lemon of a year, Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade endeavors to bring optimism to all Big Game viewers."

Scouring the stadium, he finds a pallet of Bud Light hidden in an area for which he doesnt have proper credentials. A real person catches the cutout and he takes off through the back corridors of the venue. Knowing the stadium will not provide, the cutout takes to the streets to find a beer. Finally, he sees a truck full of Bud Light, but fails to look both ways before crossing the street. A bus sweeps the cutout off his feet and eventually discards him into the gutter. The cutout is close to losing hope, but has one last idea. In a last ditch effort, he heads to the home of his non-cutout self. Thankfully, he answers the door for himself and the cutout is soon invited in. With a Bud Light finally taped to him, he kicks back to watch the Giants game with himself and his friends."

The water skier tosses away the bouquet and swings by the bar on her way out, grabbing a silver platter with two Heineken bottles. We even catch a cameo by Herve Villechaize, who played Nick Nack in the 1974 film Man With the Golden Gun. She unlocks herself from the water ski and jumps into the boat just as the bad guys are attacking the driver, Daniel Craig. Though Oddjob she is not, Zara saves the day by attaching a parasail to the assailants belt, and away he goes!"

These superpowered automatons are able to hit a seemingly unending series of hole-in-ones, pulverize a punching bag and blaze through a morning run as fast as their metallic muscles will carry them. But what good is a day spent pedaling at the gym if you cant enjoy a refreshing drink afterward?

He sneaks down the fire escape but is caught by another horde, all which are dressed in an eerily similar fashion. The jacket and sneaker-clad zombies take off in a mad dash, chasing their victim down the street and through the chaos of black-and-white selfie-taking tourists and crumbling buildings. Across the city, two of the mans friends are also being chased by groups of their streetwear doppelgangers. When he finally arrives at his destination, the man takes his shoes off and tosses them into the mob, leaving them to fight over the sneakers. Inside the sanctuary of bar, the man and his friends reunite to find solace in good conversation and cans of Miller Light. The company says a few friends are better than a few thousand followers, and raises a toast to the original social media."
