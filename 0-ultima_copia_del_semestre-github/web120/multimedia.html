      <dt><b>1). Discuss the difference between project manager and project designer</b></dt>
     	 	<dd>A project manager has the ultimate responsability for assuring that the project is in track and working propertly. The PM tasked with the responsibility of delivering the product on time, meeting the budget and delivering on promised features. They also oversee the business aspects of the development process, as such they must remain organized, focused and task oriented. Instead, the project designer is only responsable for the aperience and overall structur of the project, making sure it looks good and function correctly. The PD is responsible for producing the construction documents, and works with the PM to meet deadlines and provide them with information.</dd>
      <dt><b>2). Why is multimedia development both interactive and iterative?</b></dt>
      	<dd>It is both because during the development cycle members of the team share their knowledge and ideas (Interactive: contributing one another) and changes often take place because of feedback attained during the development process(Iterative). </dd>
      <dt><b>3). Should the content expert be the client who has contracted the multimedia application or not? Explain your choice.</b></dt>
      	<dd>The client is the only one who really know what the company needs. If the client doesnt give a good description with all the askpects that is expecting the multemedia to have. The developer wont have any idea to materialize and personalize it. It will develop a generic multimedia app that the client wont probable like as much. But if the client is not sure about the content, they should be provided with help and guidance by the team members.</dd>
      <dt><b>4). What is the importance of a storyboard in the development process?</b></dt>
      	<dd>It helps to outline media elements such as videos, photos and animations, by using (hand) drawings and sketches. It present the information you have in a organice way for you to understand and follow. It seems to be an extra step in the whole dessigning process but actually it makes it much simple. A storyboard is used to communicate with the client and to emphasizing project goals and the requirements to the development team.</dd>
